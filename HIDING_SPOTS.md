4. **Can't Move**: Frozen in place while hiding
5. **Different Views**: Camera position changes based on hiding spot type

## 🎯 Strategic Tips

### Best Hiding Spots:
1. **Attics** - Hard to reach, seeker rarely checks ceiling
2. **Under Beds** - Invisible marker, seeker must guess
3. **Behind Curtains** - Invisible marker, blend in with decor
4. **Closets** - Larger space, more room options
5. **Bathrooms** - Less traffic, often overlooked
6. **Lockers** - Quick access, but obvious

### Hiding Strategy:
- **Early Game**: Use invisible spots (bed, curtain, attic)
- **Mid Game**: Rotate between different types
- **Late Game**: Use attics or second floor spots
- **When Spotted**: Sprint to nearest spot (any type)
- **When Seeker Nearby**: Use invisible markers

### Risk vs Reward:
- **Visible Spots** (Locker, Closet, Bathroom): 
  - ✅ Easy to find for you
  - ❌ Easy to check for seeker
  
- **Invisible Spots** (Bed, Curtain, Attic):
  - ✅ Seeker can't see marker
  - ✅ Higher safety
  - ❌ Harder to locate initially
